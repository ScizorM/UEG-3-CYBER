You can use it with the green thingy that goes kaboom when your enemies are nearby to recover just a lil' bit. Just place the platferm, set the mine down, jump, then look down and beat the heck outta that thing and you'll go a bit in the air.",

Sounds like a lot of bologna to me, but you can always give it a shot and let me know how it goes.",

Who is in charge of naming these dern guns anyways?",
